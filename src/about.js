                Who am I?

            <p>
                I was born and raised in Yiwu, China, and my journey has 
                taken me across continents, shaping my understanding of 
                people and relationships along the way. Now pursuing a 
                Ph.D. at Michigan State University, I focus my research on 
                parent-adult child relationships and intergenerational 
                solidarity, driven by a deep appreciation for the 
                complexities of family dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my professional life, I love spending time with 
                my husband, playing with my cats, reading novels, playing 
                tennis, and, of course, going down YouTube rabbit holes. I 
                believe in balanceâ€”embracing curiosity, creativity, and 
                lifelong learning in everything I do.
            </p>

                Therapeutic Approach
            </div>
            <p>
                I believe that every individual, couple, and family exist 
                within a unique system, shaped by culture and personal 
                experiences. My approach is grounded in understanding these 
                complexities while fostering meaningful growth through 
                mindful and intentional interactions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Through a collaborative process, I help clients navigate 
                interpersonal challenges, strengthen communication, and 
                deepen connections. Whether working with families, couples, 
                or individuals, I strive to create a space where each 
                person feels heard, valued, and empowered to embrace their 
                journey. I am trained in Integrative Systemic Therapy (IST) 
                and Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT). In my practice, I 
                also incorporate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
                solution-focused therapy, internal family systems model 
                (IFS), and integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT).
